**Traffic Light Controller in Verilog**
**Overview**
This project implements a Traffic Light Controller using Verilog. The controller manages four traffic signals:

Main Road 1 (M1)
Main Road 2 (M2)
Main Road Turning (MT)
Side Road (S)
The controller cycles through various states to manage traffic flow efficiently, using a finite state machine (FSM) with well-defined timing and state transitions.

**Features**
State Machine Based Design: Uses an FSM to control traffic signals.
Multiple Traffic Lights: Supports four distinct signals.
Configurable Timings: Different durations for red, yellow, and green lights.
Synchronous Operation: Uses a clock signal for precise timing.
Reset Functionality: Resets to the initial state when triggered.
**Applications**
Urban Traffic Management Systems
Smart City Traffic Control
Traffic Flow Simulation
IoT-Enabled Traffic Monitoring
